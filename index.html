        <p>Labradors have many great features.  One of my favorites is how they trust their family members.  They may not trust strangers or mail carriers.  But when one adopts a labrador the dog sees family members as part of their "pack".</p>
        
        <p>Labradors also exhibit goofiness.  They do silly things.  They chase their tails.  They are fascinated with balls.  A tennis ball can entertain a labrador for days.  Eventually the labrador may rip the ball apart.  But simply give him another tennis ball and he can enjoy it just as much.</p>

        <p>Labradors know how to communicate love non-verbally.  My labrador, Dexter, uses his big, brown eyes to stare into mine.  I see so much contentment in his face.  His presence beside me or other family members is peaceful and calming.  Sure, he has times when he needs to burn off his high-energy.  But the peaceful times are great too.</p>
